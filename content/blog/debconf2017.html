We presented [Scibian, a distro for industrial R&D and engineering](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/145/) at DebConf 2017.

{%- endmark %}

The aim of this talk was to present the project, users of Scibian and how we created a Debian derivative in order to address our users needs. The talk was more focused on the HPC part of the project.

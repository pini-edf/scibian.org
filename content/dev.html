Scibian development is hosted on Github:
<https://github.com/scibian/>

Feel free to fork any existing package and submit pull requests.

If you wish to include a new package to the distribution, open an issue for the [scibian package](https://github.com/scibian/scibian) and provide the link the package repository. We'll fork it and it will be automatically included into our build system.

Source code from Github is rebuilt daily in order to generate installation media and repositories. We're using [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) and [Jenkins Debian glue](http://jenkins-debian-glue.org).

For active contributors an access to our build platform may be handy, contact us if you are in this case.

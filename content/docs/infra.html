![Scibian build infrastructure]({{ media_url('images/scibian_build_infrastructure.svg') }})

Scibian systems use a combination of Debian and Scibian package repositories.
Debian repositories are maintained by the [Debian project](http://debian.org)
community. The Scibian packages repositories only contains additional packages
or modified packages from the Debian community for the needs of scientific
computing.

The sources of the Scibian packages are maintained in Git repositories hosted
in the GitHub Scibian organization. The packages are built by a [Jenkins
instance](https://scibian.org/jenkins) setup with jenkins-debian-glue plugin.
Access to the Scibian Jenkins instance is restricted to members of the GitHub
Scibian organization.

A synchronization utility runs periodically to discover the Git repositories
and generate the appropriate Jenkins jobs. The actual package builds are
triggered manually. If packages builds are successful, Scibian package
repositories are updated with new packages.

The Scibian team members push commits directly to the Git repositories of the
GitHub Scibian organization. Other contributors are invited to fork these
repositories are send pull requests. Please [contact us]('/about.html#contact')
to become a member of the Scibian team!

Find out the [technical
documentation]({{ content_url('/docs/infra_tech.html') }}) about this build
infrastructure for administration purposes.

!!! note
    There is also a `/repo-ci` package repository which is a remainder of
    Jenkins debian-glue plugin setup. It is not intended to use it in any way.

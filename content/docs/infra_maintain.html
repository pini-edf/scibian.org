# Manage repositories content

Use the clara utility to manage manually the content of Scibian package
repository. For exemple:

* List the packages of the `scibian9` distribution:

```
clara repo list scibian9
```

* Add packages to the `scibian8Ì€  distribution:

```
clara repo add scibian8 <file>.changes
```

* Remove packages to the `scibian9`  distribution:

```
clara repo add scibian9 <package>
```

Please do NOT use `clara repo init` on the scibian.org server as distributions
must be added dynamically by `jenkins-debian-glue` only. Otherwise, it would
messes the repository distributions configuration file.

Please refer to `clara-repo` manpage for more information.

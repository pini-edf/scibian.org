title: Source Management Conventions

In order to be available in Scibian packages repositories, all source packages
must be maintained into Git repositories hosted in the GitHub [Scibian
organization](https://github.com/scibian).

All source packages Git repositories are maintained using the
[`git-buildpackage`](https://honk.sigxcpu.org/piki/projects/git-buildpackage/)
utility.

# Branches

As an extension of
[`git-buildpackage` default conventions](https://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.intro.html#gbp.repository),
the branches of the source packages Git repositories must respect the following
naming conventions, depending on the package type.

## Scibian specific native packages

* `master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

## Debian native packages modified in Scibian

* `master`: imported version of the code and packaging from Debian (basis for
  packages in the latest Scibian release).
* `debian/$codename` *(optional)*: code and packaging from specific Debian
  releases (ex: `debian/stretch`) if required by previous Scibian releases.
* `scibian/master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

The `master` and `debian/*` branches must be populated using `gbp import-dsc`.
These branches are not supposed to contain the full history of commits from the
Debian maintainers.

The default branch in GitHub repository settings must be set to `scibian/master`.

## Scibian specific quilt package

* `upstream` : imported version of the code as released by upstream developers.
* `pristine-tar`: binary delta file for pristine upstream tarballs.
* `scibian/master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

The `upstream` branch must be populated using `gbp import-orig`. This branch is
not supposed to contain the full history of commits from the upstream
developers.

The default branch in GitHub repository settings must be set to `scibian/master`.

## Debian quilt package modified in Scibian

* `upstream`: imported version of the code as released by upstream developers.
* `pristine-tar`: binary delta file for pristine upstream tarballs.
* `master`: imported version of the code and packaging from Debian (basis for
  packages in the latest Scibian release).
* `debian/$codename` *(optional)*: code and packaging from specific Debian
  releases (ex: `debian/stretch`) if required by previous Scibian releases.
* `scibian/master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

The `upstream`, `master` and `debian/*` branches must be populated using
`gbp import-dsc`. These branches are not supposed to contain the full history of
commits from the Debian maintainers.

The default branch in GitHub repository settings must be set to `scibian/master`.

## General notes

All `debian/*` et `scibian/*` branches of the Git repositories must be buildable
using [pbuilder](https://pbuilder.alioth.debian.org/) (or similar). Otherwise,
it must considered as a bug.

The `debian/*` may appear only if the packages of a previous Scibian release
relies on Debian packages derived from the list of packages imported in the
`master` branch. The diagram illustrates the case when a `debian/*` branch is
required:

![Debian branches use-case]({{ media_url('images/branches_debian_examples.svg') }})

If the packages of all the Scibian releases are based on Debian packages
successively imported in the master branch, there is no reason to have a
`debian/*` branch (case A). However, if a previous release of Scibian
requires a new Debian package derived of the master branch (eg. in case B,
Scibian 8 requires Debian package 1.1-1 **after** 2.0-1 has been imported in
master branch for Scibian 9), a specific `debian/*` branch must be created to
hold that specific Debian version of the package.

# Tags

As an extension of `git-buildpackage` default conventions, the tags of the
source packages releases in the Git repositories must respect the following
naming conventions:

* `upstream/$version`: for upstream release (ex: `upstream/1.2.3`)
* `debian/$version`: for Debian releases (ex: `debian/1.2.3-1`)
* `scibian/$version`: for Scibian releases (ex: `scibian/1.2.3-1`,
   `scibian/10-0sci9u2`, `scibian/4.3-3_bpo8+1sci8u1`)

For native packages, there is no `upstream/*` tags.

To create the Scibian releases tag using `git-buildpackage`, for example in
`scibian/master` branch, run the following command:

```
gbp buildpackage --git-tag-only \
                 --git-debian-branch=scibian/master \
                 --git-debian-tag='scibian/%(version)s' \
                 --git-debian-tag-msg='%(pkg)s Scibian release %(version)s'
```

To generate the changelog entries, for example for Scibian 8 in
`scibian/master` branch, run:

```
gbp dch --distribution=scibian8 --force-distribution \
        --debian-branch=scibian/master \
        --debian-tag='scibian/%(version)s'
```

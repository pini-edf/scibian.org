# Overview

Scibian Aspects are additional packages provided in specific distributions of
Scibian packages repository. Users can select and enable aspects with the
corresponding [APT sources](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList) depending
on their requirements. This is a modular system to easily control which
components and versions are actually installed on Scibian systems.

# Use-case

Aspects are used when packages cannot be installed on all Scibian systems. This
can happen for two reasons:

* A version of a package is specific to a hardware equipment model and may
  break support of another model.
* Scibian project wants to publish multiple conflicting versions of a package
  for a Scibian release.

If a package can be installed without trouble on all Scibian systems, it must
not be distributed in the form of an aspect.

# Names

An aspect has a short name which must be unique over the Scibian project
representing both the content and the main version of the aspect.

The aspect names must match the following regular expression: `^[a-z]+[0-9.]+$`

Some examples:

* `nv375`
* `opa10.5`
* `mlnx4.2`

This aspect name is designated with `$aspect` placeholder in the next sections
of this document.

# Sources Management 

Aspects packages follow the generic Scibian packages [sources management
conventions]({{ content_url('/docs/sources.html') }}). The following
subsections describe the few exceptions to these rules.

## Branches

The Git repositories of the sources packages distributed in aspects must
contain the following branches:

* `upstream/$aspect`: imported version of the code as released by upstream
  developers for the aspect.
* `debian/$aspect` *(optional)*: imported version of the code and packaging
  from Debian (basis for packages of the aspect in the latest Scibian release).
* `scibian/$aspect/$codename`:  code and packaging for the aspect in a Scibian
  release.
* `pristine-tar`: binary delta file for pristine upstream tarballs.

The `debian/$aspect` branch is present only if the package is imported from
Debian. If the package is developed from scratch for Scibian, this branch is
absent from the Git repository.

Multiple aspects of the same source package must be maintained in the same Git
repository. A Git repository can safely maintain multiple aspects of a package.
For example, aspects `mlnx4.2` and `opa10.5` can safely coexist in the same Git
repository. In this case, each aspect has its own branches, except the
`pristine-tar` branch common to all aspects of a package.

Somes examples :

**Exemple 1 :** `nvidia-graphics-module` version 375 in Scibian 8

Scibian 8 provides `nvidia-graphics-module` version 340 but Scibian project
also wants to publish version 375 to support latest graphic cards models. The
newer release cannot replace the older because it breaks support of some
previous graphic card models. In this case, the Scibian projects publishes the
`nvidia-graphics-module` version 375 within an aspect, for example `nv375`. The
source package is imported from Debian (ex: Debian sid). In this case, the Git
repository must contain the following branches:

* `upstream/nv375` : code as released by the upstream developers.
* `debian/nv375` : code and packaging from Debian for the aspect.
* `scibian/nv375/jessie` : code and package for the aspect in Scibian 8
* `pristine-tar`: binary delta file for pristine upstream tarballs.

**Exemple 2 :** `gpfs` 3.5 and 4.2 in Scibian 8

The Scibian project wants to publish the GPFS software in versions 3.5 and 4.2
for Scibian 8. The software editor provides the source tarballs without
packaging code. The packaging code must be developed from scratch by the
Scibian project. The aspects can be named `gpfs3.5` and `gpfs4.2`. The Git
repository must contain the following branches:

* `upstream/gpfs3.5`: code as released by the upstream developers for version 3.5.
* `upstream/gpfs4.2`: code as released by the upstream developers for version 4.2.
* `scibian/gpfs3.5/jessie`: code and packaging for version 3.5 in Scibian 8.
* `scibian/gpfs4.2/jessie`: code and packaging for version 4.2 in Scibian 8.
* `pristine-tar`: binary delta file for pristine upstream tarballs.

**Exemple 3:** `libumad` from different stacks and multiple Scibian releases

The `libumad` package is distributed as Debian packages by both Mellanox and
Intel within their respective low-latency network software stacks. The Scibian
project wants to distribute `libumad` from Intel OPA 10.5 for Scibian 8 and
`libumad` from Mellanox OFED 4.2 for Scibian 8 and Scibian 9. The aspects can
be named `opa10.5` and `mlnx4.2`. In this case, the Git repository must contain
the following branches:

* `upstream/opa10.5`: code as released in Intel OPA 10.5 stack.
* `upstream/mlnx4.2`: code as release in Mellanox OFED 4.2 stack.
* `debian/opa10.5` : code and debian packaging as released in Intel 10.5 stack.
* `debian/mlnx4.2`: code and debian packaging as release in Mellanox OFED 4.2
  stack.
* `scibian/opa10.5/jessie`: code and packaging for aspect `opa10.5` in
  Scibian 8.
* `scibian/mlnx4.2/jessie`: code and packaging for aspect `mlnx4.2` in
  Scibian 8.
* `scibian/mlnx4.2/wheezy`: code and packaging for aspect `mlnx4.2` in
  Scibian 9.
* `pristine-tar`: binary delta file for pristine upstream tarballs.

## Tags

The tags must respect the following format:
`{upstream,debian,scibian}/$aspect/$version`

Some examples :

* `upstream/opa10.5/10.5.2`
* `debian/opa10.5/10.5.2-1`
* `scibian/opa10.5/10.5.2-1sci8+opa10.5u1`

# Packaging Conventions

Aspects packages follow the generic Scibian [packaging
conventions]({{ content_url('/docs/pkgs.html') }}). The following subsections
describe the few exceptions to these rules.

## Versions

The versions of the packages distributed in aspects must respect the following
format:

```
[epoch:]<upstream_version>-<debian_revision>sci<scibian_version>+<aspect>u<scibian_release>
```

Where `<aspect>` is the name of the aspect.

Some examples :

* `1.2.3-1` released in Debian → `1.2.3-1sci8+opa10.5u1` for 1<sup>st</sup>
  release of a package in aspect `opa10.5` for Scibian 8, `1.2.3-1sci9+nv375u3`
  for 3<sup>rd</sup> release in aspect `nv375` for Scibian 9.
* `1.2.3` released upstream → `1.2.3-0sci8+opa10.5u1` for 1<sup>st</sup>
  release in aspect `opa10.5` for Scibian 8.

It is more convenient if packages distributed in aspects have greater version
number then the same packages in the corresponding Scibian release, if any.
However, this is not a hard requirement as APT must be setup with higher
priority for aspects.

## Distribution

In the `debian/changelog` file, the distribution of the entries must respect thefollowing format:

```
scibian<X>+<aspect>
```

Some examples:

* `scibian8+opa10.5`
* `scibian9+nv375`
